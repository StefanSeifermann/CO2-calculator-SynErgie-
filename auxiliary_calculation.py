    Check and adapt given case of flexibility measure and append reformatted
    row to data frame.
check_and_adapt_dsm : 
    The given case of a flexibility measure is checked for plausibility and 
    adapted, if required.

    This method checks the given specific case of an energy flexibility measure
    and adapts it, if required. The row is reformatted, such that it only contains
    relevant data for the further calculation, and is appended to a new data frame.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    row : pandas.Series
        The data of a flexibility measure. 
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        New data frame to which the adapted and reformatted case of the 
        flexibility measure is append to. 
    scope : str
        Can take the values 'potential' or 'perspective' to select the specific 
        case of the flexibility measure.
    maximization : str
        Can take the values 'power' or 'retrieval duration' to select the 
        specific case of the flexibility measure. 
    load_change : str
        Can take the values 'load increase' or 'load reduction' to select the 
        specific case of the flexibility measure. 
        
    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        Updated data frame with the defined specific case of the flexibility
        measure.
